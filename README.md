The device can be designed to be weatherproof and used outdoors, is easily controlled via Wi-Fi and has extensive functionality, including automatic brightness algorithms, WEB UI, DST, time zones, night mode, temperature compensation, color themes and over-the-air firmware updates (OTA). The clock is based on ESP8266 but can also be adapted to ESP12 or Arduino modules.
